Important notes: 

1.	The subset of households for the SAGCOT area from the Tanzania LSMS 2013 
      data has been selected based on the main regions falling within the 
	  SAGCOT boundaries. We are currently working on improving the selection 
	  process by selecting only households that have enumeration areas falling 
	  within the SAGCOT boundaries. 
2.  National level estimates for Ghana are estimated from published record, and are
      thus excluded from analysis.
