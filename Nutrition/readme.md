The script Nutrition.VS.Individual.R calculates seven different sub-indicators of nutrition:
 * Overweight
 * Underweight
 * Severe Underweight
 * Stunting
 * Severe Stunting 
 * Wasting
 * Severe Wasting

It also calculates the indicator of Composite Index of Anthropometric
Failure (CIAF), (Nandy and Svedberg 2012).  CIAF essentially indicates if a child has 
stunting OR wasting OR underweight.

The indicator and subindicators were calculated at the individual level for all children
5 years old or younger in the VS database.  It should be easy to aggregate at the national
or Landscape level.

The latitude and longitude in the output table are at the VS Landscape level.
