Important notes: 

1.	The subset of households for the SAGCOT area from the Tanzania LSMS 2013 
      data has been selected based on the main regions falling within the 
	  SAGCOT boundaries. We are currently working on improving the selection 
	  process by selecting only households that have enumeration areas falling 
	  within the SAGCOT boundaries. 
2.  National level estimates for Ghana cannot be estimated from the GLSS national 
      data, due to anonymization

  1. Tanzania: LSMS 2013 at the SAGCOT level
###################################################

The Nutrition indicators are generated for the SAGCOT area using the LSMS 2013 data, 
   and the WHO child growth standards to obtain nutritional indicators.
 
Nutrition.TZA.R: script that takes the TZA LSMS 2013 data and WHO child growth 
   standards as input, and calculates the set of nutrition indicators as a csv file 
   with the main indicators from the thread:
•	N3 Overvweight
•	N4 Underweight
•	N5 Stunting
•	N6 Wasting

Nutrition.TZA.R references a set of functions from the following R files:
igrowup_standard.R - contains functions that calculate the prevalence and incidence 
   of anthro scores, provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Nutrition.R - contains a set of functions for determining indicators from prevalence
   and incidence rates.

  2. Vital Signs at landscape level (Tier 4)
###################################################

The Nutrition indicators are generated for each VS landscape using the VS Household 
   survey data, and the WHO child growth standards to obtain nutritional indicators.
 
Nutrition.VS.R: script that takes the VS Household survey data and WHO child growth 
   standards as input, and calculates the set of nutrition indicators as a csv file 
   with the main indicators from the thread:
•	N3 Overvweight
•	N4 Underweight
•	N5 Stunting
•	N6 Wasting

Nutrition.TZA.R references a set of functions from the following R files:
igrowup_standard.R - contains functions that calculate the prevalence and incidence 
   of anthro scores, provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Nutrition.R - contains a set of functions for determining indicators from prevalence
   and incidence rates.
VS.R - contains a set of common data staging functions for use with the VS household 
   and agriculture surveys

  3. Ghana: GLSS 5 at the national level
###################################################

The Nutrition indicators are generated for Ghana using the same process as the 
   Tanzania national level analysis. The difference is the national data source
   (Ghana Living Standards Survey, 5th wave GLSS 5) and the subsequent staging. Note that
   the publically available data will not contain the necessary columns (height, weight)
   to calculate the nutrition indicators for Ghana.
   
Nutrition.GHA.R: script that takes the GLSS 5 data and WHO child growth 
   standards as input, and calculates the set of nutrition indicators as a csv file 
   with the main indicators from the thread:
•	N3 Overvweight
•	N4 Underweight
•	N5 Stunting
•	N6 Wasting

Nutrition.GHA.R references a set of functions from the following R files:
igrowup_standard.R - contains functions that calculate the prevalence and incidence 
   of anthro scores, provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).

   and incidence rates.
