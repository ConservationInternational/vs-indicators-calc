# R Code for Vital Signs Indicators
###### This repo will store reusable and clean R code that will utilize VS protocl data and external datasets to produce Vital Signs indicators and indicies. Please adhere to this R programming style [guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) and be sure to use comments in your code that very clearly describe what a particular chunk of code is doing. 

Here is the process to get started:
* Each institution will work in teams on the indicators they agreed upon.
* All R coders need a github account and should be pushing/pulling R code here. 
* Install Github within Rstudio - [Instructions](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html)
* Let's have eveyrone work off the master branch until we feel there is a reason and people are comfortable with branching.
* R code should access all data (except not with personally identifiable information) from directly within their R code. This means that the first section of each main R program should include a data acquisition and loading section. 
* We are all in this together (for better or worse!) so let's help each other out as we can. For example, let's standardize how we load in datasets. Eric, Alex and possibly another person will be serving as a 'help' squad to the teams working on the code. We also may place comments in your code to help make sure some things are done consistently throughout the R programs.  
* The data will be undergoing constant data review. We will update everyone on structure changes (and keep these to a minimum) but data values may be updated at any time. Write your code in a way that you are not dependent on a specific data value.

######Data Errors?!
You will find errors in the data. Please register the error [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TExfUyZ6u9qbYnFvUit1IpIQNsb2cJvxPK9JjqQuJ3g/edit#gid=0) and we will address the error and identify the source. You may need to develop a work-around until the actual data is corrected but we will go through this on a case by case basis.
